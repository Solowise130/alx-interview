Rotate 2D Matrix


Matrix Rotation is defined as rotating the elements of the array around its center in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, or rotating the elements by some position in clockwise or anticlockwise or interchanging of rows and columns. 

To rotate a 2D matrix (or 2D list in Python) 90 degrees clockwise in-place, you can employ the following approach:

+ Transpose the Matrix: Convert all rows into columns.

+ Reverse Each Row: After the transpose, reversing each row will give you a 90-degree clockwise rotated matrix.

TASK
0. Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):

Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.

You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
