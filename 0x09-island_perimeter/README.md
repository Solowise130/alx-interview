 Island Perimeter

The perimeter of an island, or any other closed shape, is the distance around its outer boundary. In the context of an island, it refers to the total length of the coastline or the outer edge of the landmass when viewed from above.

Calculating the perimeter of an island can vary in complexity depending on the shape of the island. If the island is a simple geometric shape like a rectangle or a circle, the perimeter can be easily calculated using the appropriate formulas for those shapes.

This Project creates a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

- grid is a list of list of integers:

- 0 represents water

- 1 represents land

- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1

- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).

- grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100

- The grid is completely surrounded by water

- There is only one island (or nothing).

- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
